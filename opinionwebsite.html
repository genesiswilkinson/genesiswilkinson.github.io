<p> Throught looking at websites and judging them based on their elements, I stumbled across the world worst website ever!</p>
 <link href="https://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com" rel= "link">
<p> The first thing that you notice is the obnoxious fonts. There are at least ten diffrent fonts surrounded by things like sparkles, glitter and diffrent kinds of borders. There is really no point to the website...besides to be labeled as "The Worlds Worst Website Ever". There are tons of diffrent colors which make the site look messy and very busy. The coding is crazy and it has a bunch of diffrent tables all with diffrent widths.Nothing is organized with a purpose. You can see in the code all the difrent crazy fonts that they used.It does function properly in terms of scrolling, but when you minimize it, it does not allow you to see the whole page.It just shirnks the whole thing. The layout is crazy and very unorganized.    </p>
