<title> Opnion Website</title>

<p> Throught looking at websites and judging them based on their elements, I stumbled across the world worst website ever!
 <a href="https://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com">website</a>?<br />
The first thing that you notice is the obnoxious fonts. There are at least ten diffrent fonts surrounded by things like sparkles, glitter and diffrent kinds of borders. There is really no point to the website...besides to be labeled as "The Worlds Worst Website Ever". There are tons of diffrent colors which make the site look messy and very busy. The coding is crazy and it has a bunch of diffrent tables all with diffrent widths.Nothing is organized with a purpose. You can see in the code all the difrent crazy fonts that they used.It does function properly in terms of scrolling, but when you minimize it, it does not allow you to see the whole page or in other words, it is not mobil friendly.It just shirnks the whole thing. The layout is crazy and very unorganized.</p>
<p>Unlike the "Worlds Worst Website" The state of Montana's offical site is very clean. <a href="https://mt.gov">website</a><br />The fonts are kept to a minimum and the overall look is very proffesional. The first thing I noticed was the beautiful Montana background. Giving off a sense of the true beauty of Montana. The second thing I noticed was how user friendly it is. All ages would be able to navigate through it. The layout is very organized with all the important and most frequently visited areas available first. All the links lead to another well organized and clean page. I even liked how they have their social media available on the side bar.The live features in the middle of the screen show upcoming news and information about activites, featured recourses and new realeses available to the public.As you scroll down it countnues to stay organized and clean with plenty of white space to make it feel not as busy to the user. At the end of the page they have put together a nice gallery of the beauty of nature throughout the state of Montana which I found to be a really nice feature and made the site feel more welcoming. Throughout the HTML, I noticed a ton of unordered lists which help to make your page look more organized and clean. The rest of the HTML also looks really organized and has everything labled.They use plenty of h1 and h2 elememnts to give a header to the main ideas on the site. The other great thing is that it is mobil friendly, so when you shrink the page or go on it on your mobil device, you can still see the entire website on your screen.

<p> Another good example of a "good" website would be Nike. <a href="https://www.nike.com">website</a>?<br /> This is by far my favorite website! I love how modern it is. It has plenty of white space to give it a clean and cool look. The feature, logos and layout all help to make the site look more professional and expensive. All of the pictures match eachother and have a purpose. Along with all the upfront links. The links that we notice first are all most frequently needed when coming onto the site. For example they have the search bar and then a mens, womens and kids catagory all labeled at the top. I like how some of the pictures are live pictures, that shows the purpose of the site, which is athletics.However, the HTML made absolutly zero sense to me. Nothing was orgazied or labeled. There was no unordered or ordered lists. No tables or color to indicate anything. Everything is all jumbeled together but yet it still makes a functional and very good website. </p>
